Title: Reads Data Files in Nested Folder Structure
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Pranav", "Sachdev", email = "pranavsachdev5@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: 
    1. This package is designed to read files of the format (csv/xlsx/xls), so any other files that reside within the folder structure, eg. PDF, txt, etc; will be ignored.
    2. The naming convention of the read files will be: 
        a.	For CSV:	 ProjData_<FolderName1>_<FolderName2>_<FolderName3>._filename
        b.	For XLSX/XLS:	ProjData_<FolderName1>_<FolderName2>_<FolderName3>._filename_SheetName1
   	                      ProjData_<FolderName1>_<FolderName2>_<FolderName3>._filename_SheetName2
    3. A report of files which could not be read (maybe due to corrupt data) will be generated for reference in the end.
